# Data Poisoning LLMs

This project aims to examine data poisoning techniques in datasets of text, and apply them to a website as a preventative measure for scrapers.

This project will...

- Perform Data Poisoning on a Series of Articles
- Show how data poisoned by these functions will look on the site when a scraper/crawler accesses it
- Cover how to identify scraping traffic on a site
- Add NextJS Implementations to add to my site
